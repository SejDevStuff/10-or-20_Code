## Disclaimer!
MicroBits are fragile micro-computers. They DO make the game easier and more fun but it is **not our responsibility if your microbit breaks or suffers from damage**.
If you are worried about this, you may put your microbit in a protective casing or not bring it at all.
If you are not worried about this, continue downloading the microbit!
